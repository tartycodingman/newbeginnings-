start
today was great. I got to hang out and go
rollerskating. but since I don't know how
to roller skate, I may have fell down 3 times
in a row. so I just returned the shoes and went
to the arcade. i had like $5.50 so I could buy
myself 10 credits and my friend bought me
10 more credits to play games. at least the place
was fun. The only prizes I got were a flute
and a emerald ring.
